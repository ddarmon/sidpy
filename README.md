sidpy: Python Tools for Specific Information Dynamics
=====================================================

What is sidpy?
---------------

<b>sidpy</b> is a Python package for estimating quantities from <b>s</b>pecific <b>i</b>nformation <b>d</b>ynamics such as [specific entropy rate](http://www.mdpi.com/1099-4300/18/5/190) and [specific transfer entropy](https://journals.aps.org/pre/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevE.96.022121) from data, as well as local information dynamics via the [Java Information Dynamics Toolbox (JIDT)](https://github.com/jlizier/jidt). <b>sidpy</b> also incorporates model selection routines to determine the appropriate model order for scalar and input-output time series.

Installation
------------
